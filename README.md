Easy GUI tool to download any bones album.
Exe can be found under release.

How to use:

1. Download zip or exe file (first try exe, if you have problems download the release zip).
2. Extract zip file using any tool you like (if you downloaded the exe this is not necessary)
2. Open BoneAlbumDownloader.exe
3. Enter the dropdown menu and select any album you wish to download
4. The program will ask for your pc username. this is because files are downloaded to C:\Users\USERNAME\Downloads\ (this horrendous method might be patched in update).
5. Your file will now be stored in rar format. This can be unpacked with any program you like

If you're having issues with the file location you can set the download location yourself. This can be any folder but DIRECTLY the C:\ drive. If you do this, the program will crash.
